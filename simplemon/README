How to set it up:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

a) Install the Mail::Sendmail module. The easiest way to do that is to use
CPAN:

# perl -MCPAN -e shell
(Answer no to the question about manual configuration.)
cpan> install Mail::Sendmail

b) Change variables and what to monitor in simplemon.cfg. Make sure you write
correct Perl syntax.

c) Start simplemon.pl simply by running it.

That's it!
